# bundle-cop üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Generate a bundle size comparison between two different branches

You can see an example [here](https://bundle-cop-dbgxvwjdtx.now.sh/)

### Usage
```sh
$ bundle-cop --branch master
```

Bundle cop compares the current branch with the one specified using the `--branch` command.

After comparing, it will generate an `index.html` file which is automatically has a breakdown of file size changes

Both branches will need to contain a `npm run build-analyze` script that ensures we're using our `webpack-bundle-analyzer` plugin.

You'll want to use this webpack plugin as well

```sh
npm i webpack-bundle-analyzer --save-dev
```

and your `next.config.js` will need something like this:

```js
const { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer')

..

if (process.env.ANALYZE) {
  config.plugins.push(new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
    statsFilename: 'stats.json',
    analyzerMode: 'disabled',
    generateStatsFile: true
  ))
}
```
