# bundle-cop üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Generate and deploy (via now.sh) a bundle size comparison between two different branches

### Usage
```sh
$ bundle-cop --branch master --team eaze --token process.env.NOW_TOKEN
```

Bundle cop compares the current branch with the one specified using the `--branch` command.

After comparing, it will generate an `index.html` file which is automatically deployed now, so you also need to specify the `--team` and `--token` flags for deploys to be successful

Both branches will need to contain a `npm run build-analyze` script.
